# The impact of heat pumps on day-ahead energy community load forecasting

We publish most forecasting methods, our benchmarking pipeline, all feature-engineered and selected data, as well as our final results of the paper "The impact of heat pumps on day-ahead energy community load forecasting" (Semmelmann et al., 2024) in this repository. We encourage fellow researchers and practitioners to use our pipeline to benchmark novel load forecasting methods for households, heat pumps and energy communuities featuring heat pumps and regular load.
